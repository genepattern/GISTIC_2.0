Notes on file sources
Unless noted here, files came from successful runs of 2.0.22 on a Broad hosted server.

segmentationfile.all_data_by_genes.txt is a benchmark file from the latest run of GISTIC 2.0.23 on gpbroad.
It appears that this file's second column name changed from "Locus ID" to "Gene ID" going from version 2.0.22 to 2.0.23 - all other data in the file remains the same.
